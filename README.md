# ScriptKitties
A script to automate playing the addicting <a href="http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/#">Kittens Game</a>

## How do I use the script?

If you want to use this, feel free to bookmark:

    javascript:(function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tumitumi/KittensGame/ScriptKitties.js';d.body.appendChild(s);})();

or just paste it directly into the console. Once loaded, the button to get to the ScriptKitties option menu is in the bottom right "footer" links.


## What does it do?

Currently this script will automatically do the following:

1) Build
2) Craft
3) Hunt
4) Trade
5) Praise
6) Research Science
7) Upgrade Workshop
8) Festival
9) Energy Control


## What are some interesting details?

<b>BUILD:</b>  ScriptKitties will automatically build any of the buildings on the Bonfire tab, and it lets you choose exactly which ones you want! If you want to turn on or off an entire group of buildings, just click the header.

<b>CRAFT:</b> ScriptKitties keeps your resources from capping out! You can be sure to keep a healthy supply of crafted resources coming!

<b>HUNT:</b> Don't let your catpower go to waste! Automatically send your kittens on hunting expeditions to get your furs, ivory, and unicorns!

<b>TRADE:</b> Automagically trade with Zebras and the Elders! Keep your titanium stores full and never miss a visit from the Elders!

<b>PRAISE:</b> Want a praise bonus that will make a difference? Turn on Auto Praise and see your faith based productivity skyrocket by praising the sun every tick!

<b>RESEARCH:</b> Don't let your kitten kingdom stagnate! As soon as you have the requirements, ScriptKitties will make sure to research new technologies for you.

<b>UPGRADE:</b> Want to upgrade your buildings and abilities, but don't want to just sit there waiting? Let the script make upgrades whenever you are able!

<b>FESTIVAL:</b> If you have the resources, ScriptKitties will keep the party going!

<b>ENERGY:</b> Don't worry about having negative energy or wasted potential! Turn on Energy Control, and you will stay between 0 and 3 Watts of surplus power!

You can use this script as much or as little as you like, but if you turn on all the options, it will basically run the Kittens Game from reset to reset.

Enjoy!
